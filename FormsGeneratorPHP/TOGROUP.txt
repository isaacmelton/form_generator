So for unit testing, go to this website: https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html

Follow the installation instructions for whichever OS you're using.

If you take a look at the testing folder I've created, I've provided a sample_test.php that you can run from the commandline via: phpunit FILE_NAME.php.  You'll NEED to include the first two functions to establish the connection and load the seed.xml.

Let me know if you have any questions. :)
